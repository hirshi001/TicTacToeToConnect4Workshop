# TicTacToeToConnect4Workshop
This is a template of classes which will be used for a Java Game Design workshop where the students will be creating a Connect 4 game through the console by the end of the workshop.

# How this template works:
1. At the start of the workshop, the students should create a ConnectFour class, which is the only class which they will be creating
2. In the ConnectFour class, they will start to build their project, however the project will be a simple Tic-Tac-Toe (the code can be found in TicTacToeP1)
3. After they finish it, they will add enhancements to the Tic-Tac-Toe project they have created in which the final code for these enhancements will be found in TicTacToeP2. These enhancements will bring the game closer to Connect-4.
4. Do the same as step 3, but the final code for the enhancements will be found in TicTacToeP4
5. Now look in the ConnectFour class provided in this repository. The students will modify their code to look like that, which will be the completed version of Connect 4.
6. If there are ConnectFourP2, P3, P4, etc.. classes provided in this repository, they will contain enhancements which can be made to the ConnectFour game

# Each class
At the top of each class (not the file, but the actual class itself), there will be commented out statements which say which enhancments/changes the class has in comparison to the prevoius version.
